Governance Maturity And Ethical Leadership In AI-Integrated Public Administration: Evidence From Indonesia's Decentralized Bureaucracy
This study investigates how AI governance maturity and ethical leadership shape public service performance within AI-integrated public institutions in Indonesia’s decentralized governance system (2026). Employing an explanatory mixed-method design, the research advances the AI-GEP Model to examine how structural governance capacity and normative leadership orientation influence multidimensional performance outcomes, including responsiveness, transparency, accountability, service equity, and citizen trust. The findings demonstrate that sustainable performance in autonomous bureaucracies depends not merely on technological adoption, but on the institutional maturity of AI governance frameworks and the ethical engagement of leadership actors. By introducing the concept of Algorithmic Institutionalism within a decentralized democratic context, this study contributes to the emerging scholarship on governance-dependent performance in algorithmically mediated public administration.
